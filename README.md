# Smooth-Gradient-Fabric-Generator

This project aims to create visually appealing images of colorful fabrics with smooth transitions between colors across space (coordinates). The generated fabric images can be customized with various color sets, allowing for creativity and exploration of different visual effects.

## Features

1. **Colorful Fabric Generation:** The code generates images of colorful fabrics with smoothly changing colors across the fabric's surface. This creates visually engaging patterns and textures resembling real fabrics.

2. **Customizable Color Sets:** Users can experiment with different color palettes to achieve desired visual effects. Whether it's vibrant and bold colors or subtle and soothing tones, the code allows for flexibility in color selection.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** The code computes the mean and standard deviation of each color channel (red, green, blue) in the generated fabric images. This provides insights into the overall color distribution and variation within the image.

4. **Histogram Generation:** Additionally, histograms are drawn for each color channel, visually representing the distribution of pixel intensities. This helps users understand the distribution of colors and the dominant hues present in the fabric image.

## Implementation

The fabric image is created by smoothly transitioning between colors across the image's coordinates. This smooth transition is achieved using mathematical functions or algorithms that interpolate between colors.

The fabric image is then separated into its red, green, and blue channels. This separation allows for individual analysis of each color component.

Next, the mean and standard deviation of each color channel are calculated. The mean provides insight into the average intensity of each color channel, while the standard deviation indicates the spread of pixel intensities around the mean.

Histograms are generated for each color channel using the pixel intensities. These histograms visualize the distribution of pixel values, showing the frequency of each intensity level.
